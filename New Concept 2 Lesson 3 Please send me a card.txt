1.参考译文 3 Please send me a card

明信片总搅得我假日不得安宁。去年夏天，我去了意大利。

我参观了博物馆，还去了公园。一位好客的服务员教了我几句意大利语，之后还借给我一本书。

我读了几行，但一个字也不懂。我每天都想着明信片的事。假期过得真快，可我还没有给我的朋友们寄过一张明信片。

到了最后一天，我作出了一项重大决定。我早早起了床，买来了37张明信片。

我在房间里关了整整一天。然而竟连一张明信片也没写成！

2.中译英

Postcards always spoil my holiday. Last summer, I went to Italy.

I visited the museums, and sat in the public gardens. A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian, then he lent me a book.

I read a few lines, but I didn't understand a word. I thought about the postcards everyday.

My holidays passed quickly, but I didn't send cards to my friends.

On the last day, I made a big decision. I got up early, and bought 37 cards.

I spend the whole day in my room, but I didn't write a single card.
