1.参考译文 20 One man in the boat

钓鱼是我特别喜爱的一项运动。我经常一钓数小时却一无所获，但我从不为此烦恼。
有些垂钓者就是不走运，他们往往鱼钓不到，却钓上来些旧靴子和垃圾。
我的运气甚至还不及他们。我什么东西也未钓到过 -- 就连旧靴子也没有。我总是在河上呆上整整一上午，然后空着袋子回家。
“你可别再钓鱼了！”我的朋友们说，“这是浪费时间。”
然而他们没有认识到重要的一点，我并不是真的对钓鱼有兴趣，我感兴趣的只是独坐孤舟，无所事事！

2.中译英

Fishing is my favourite sport, I often fish for hours without catching anything, but this does not worry me.
Some fishermen are unlucky. Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and rubbish.
I am even less lucky. I never catch anything -- not even old boots. After having spent the whole mornings on the river, I always go home with an empty bag.
"You must give up fishing" my friends say, "it's a waste of time"
But they don't realize one important thing, I am not really interested in fishing, I am only interested in sitting in a boat and doing nothing at all.
