1.参考译文 103&104 The French test

加 里：考试考得怎样，理查德？

理查德：不算太坏，我想我的英语和数学及格了。题目很容易。加里，你怎么样？

加 里：英语和数学试题对我来说不很容易。我希望别不及格。

理查德：我想我的法语及不了格，我能回答其中的16道题。这些题很容易。但我回答不出其作的题。那些题对“我来说太难了。

加 里：法语太可怕了，你说呢？

理查德：我讨厌法语。我的法语成绩肯定很低。

加 里：啊，别灰心！或许我们考得还不太糟。坐在我旁边的那个人只在试卷顶端写自己的名字。

理查德：是吗？

加 里：然后他就坐在那里，对着考卷看了3个小时，一个字也没写！
