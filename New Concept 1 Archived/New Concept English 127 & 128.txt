1.参考译文 127&128 A famous actress

凯特：莉兹，你能认出那个女人吗？

莉兹：我想我认得出来，凯特。那一定是女演员卡.马会。

凯特：我也这样想。她旁边的那个人是谁？

莉兹：一定是康拉德.里弗斯。

凯特：康拉德.里弗斯，那个男演员吗？不可能是。让我再看一看。我想你是对的。他不是她的第3个丈夫吗？

莉兹：不，他一定是她的第4个或第5个丈夫。

凯特：卡伦看上去不显老嘛！

莉兹：是的，谁说不是呢！我从报上看到她是29岁，但她一定至少有40岁了。

凯特：我肯定她有40岁了。

莉兹：当我还是学生时，她就是个著名的演员了。

凯特：那是好久以前的事了。是吗？

莉兹：不，没有那么久。我自己现在还没29岁呢。
