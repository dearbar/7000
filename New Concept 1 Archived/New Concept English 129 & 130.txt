1.参考译文 129&130 Seventy miles an hour

安：瞧，加里！那个警察正朝你挥手呢。他要你停下来。

警察：你认为你现在是在哪儿？在赛车道上吗？你刚才一定是以每小时70英里的速度开车。

加里：我不会开得那么快的。

警察：我是以第小时80英里的速度赶上你的。

警察：难道你没看见限速牌吗？

加里：恐怕我没有看见，警官。我一定思想开小差了。

安：警官，他思想没有开小差。我刚才正告诉他开慢点。

安里：所以我才没看见那牌子。

警察：让我看一看你的驾驶执照。

警察：这次我就不罚你款了。但你最好不要再开得这样快。

加里：谢谢您。我以后一定会多加注意。

安：加里，我刚才叫你开慢点吧。

加里：你总是叫我开慢点，亲爱的。

安：好啦，下次你最好还是听从我的劝告！
