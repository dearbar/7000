夏洛特：我来煮点咖啡好吗，简？

简：这是个好主意，夏洛特。

夏洛特：咖啡好了，你要放点奶吗？

简：请稍加一点。

夏洛特：加些糖怎么样？两茶匙行吗？

简：太好了。

夏洛特：你再来点吗？

简：好的，请再来一点。

简：我还想抽枝烟。可以给我一枝吗？

夏洛特：当然可以。我想那个盒子里有一些。

夏洛特：真遗憾！

简：没关系。

夏洛特：那就吃块饼干吧。多吃点，少抽点！

简：这是极好的忠告啊！

Shall I make some coffee, Jane

That's a good idea, Charlotte

It's ready, do you want any milk

Just a little, please

What about some sugar, two teaspoonfuls

No, less than that, one and a half of teaspoonfuls, that is enough for me

That was very nice

Do you want some more

Yes, please

I'd like have a cigarette too, may I have one

Sure, of course. I think there are a few in that box

I afraid it is empty

What a pity

It doesn't matter

Have a biscuit instead, eat more, smoke less

That's a good advice.
