1.参考译文 22 A glass envelope



我的女儿简从未想过会接到荷兰一位同龄姑娘的来信。去年，当我们横渡英吉利海峡时，简把写有她姓名和住址的一张纸条装进了一只瓶子，又将瓶子扔进了大海。此后她就再没去想那只瓶子。但10个月以后，她收到了荷兰一位姑娘的来信。现在这两位姑娘定期通信了。然而她们还是决定利用邮局。这样会稍微多花点钱，但肯定是快得多了。

2.中译英

My daughter, Jane, never dreamed of receiving from a girl of her own age in Holland. Last year, we were travelling across the channel and Jane put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a bottle and she threw it into the sea. She never thought of it again. But 10 months later, she received a letter from a girl in Holland. Both girls write to each other regularly now. However they have decided to use the post office. That will cost a little more, but it certainly travel faster.
