1.参考译文 28 No parking

贾斯珀.怀特是少有的相信古代神话的人之一。他刚在城里买下一所新房子，但自从搬进去后，就和汽车及车主们发生了磨擦。当他夜里回到家时，总是发现有人把车停在他家大门外。为此，他甚至一次也没能把自己的车开进车库。贾斯珀曾把几块“禁止停车”的牌子挂在大门外边，但没有任何效果。现在他把一个丑陋的石雕头像放在了大门上边，这是我见过的最丑陋的头像之一。我问他那是什么？他告诉我那是蛇发女怪美杜莎。贾斯珀希望她把汽车和车主们都变成石头。但到目前为止还没有一个变成石头呢！


2.中译英

Jasper White is one of those rare people who believes in ancient myths. He has just bought a new house in the city, but ever since he moved in, he has had some troubles with the cars and their owners. When he returns home at night, he always finds that someone parked a car outside his gate. Because of this, he has not been able to get his own car into the garage. Jasper ever put up the "No parking" signs outside his gate, but these have not had any effect. Now he put an ugly stone head over the gate, it is one of the most ugliest faces I ever seen. I asked him what it was? He told me it is Medusa. Jasper hopes that she will turn the cars and their owners to stone. But none of them has been turn to stone yet!
