1.参考译文 14 Do you speak English

去年我有过一次有趣的经历。在离开法国南部的一个小村庄后，我继续驶往下一个城镇。
途中，一个青年人向我招手。我把车停下，他向我提出要求搭车。
他一上车，我就用法语向他问早上好，他也同样用法语回答我。除了个别几个单词外，我根本不会法语。
旅途中我们谁也没讲话。就要到达那个镇时，那青年突然开了口，慢慢地说道：“你会讲英语吗？”

我很快了解到，他自己就是个英国人！

last year I had an interesting experience. After I had left a small village in the north of France, I drove on to the next town.
On my way, a young person waved to me. I stopped, and he ask me for a lift.
As soon as he had got into the car, I said good morning in French, he answer me in same language. Apart from few words, I didn't know any French at all.
Neither of us spoke during the journey. When I had nearly reached the town, the young person said suddenly, very slowly, do you speak English?

As I soon realize, he was an English himself.
